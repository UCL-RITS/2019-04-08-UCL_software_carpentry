Our goal is to help researchers across college become more productive by
teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version control,
testing, and task automation. In this two-day workshop, short tutorials will
alternate with hands-on practical exercises. Participants will be encouraged
both to help one another, and to apply what they have learned to their own
research problems during and between sessions. The course is aimed at UCL
postgraduate students and research staff who are familiar with basic programming
concepts (like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to
translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more
productively. We strongly recommend that cohorts from a research group register
together if possible, to achieve best peer-support following the event.
